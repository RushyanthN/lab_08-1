    "# Intro to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Natural Language Processing (NLP) field is incredibly vast, and it has applications in virtually every aspect of data science. In this notebook, we will walk through a **very brief** survey of NLP, and provide some instruction on a couple handy tools along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP tools span a wide range of implementations, and it is not uncommon for NLP packages to have conflicts with other Python libraries. So, to keep everything compatible in one place, it is recommended that you create a new pip environment for NLP projects. To set up an NLP pip environment for this lab, follow the steps in the \"Pip Environment\" section of the [Python Environment Setup page in Canvas](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2181786/pages/week-1-%7C-python-environment-setup?module_item_id=30340853), and **use the *environment.yml* file provided in this folder.** This should install the packages you'll need for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **[download a spaCy NLP model](https://spacy.io/models)** based on your preferences (in the NLP environment) so you can use the spaCy library installed in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optionally, if you prefer to use a different environment, install the following packages separately using pip: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installing-the-latest-release), [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage), [ScatterText](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext#installation), [CorEx](https://ryanjgallagher.github.io/code/corex/example), and [vaderSentiment](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#installation).*"

    "When spaCy processes text, it runs it through a [pipeline](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines) of different models to store token attributes for each token. This is how we get the functionality above. Though, when we are tokenizing multiple documents, we might not need all of these [built-in components](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#built-in). For example, we might just need enough to filter our text based on the analysis done.\n",

    "**[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is the industry standard data science toolkit**, and it's modules are used in almost every aspect of data science. Here, we are going to use its [feature extraction module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html), which is built for extracting numerical features from data such as text or images. We will be using it for vectorization of text data, and in these cases, the scikit-learn process is:\n",

    "4. Transform the data based on the model's parameters using `.transform`\n",

    "\n",
    "[CorEx](https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic) is a discriminative model, which starts from $X$ (documents/words) to determine $Y$ (topics). CorEx looks for groups of words that are in the same topic, a.k.a. have high Total Correlation (TC), or convey the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If words are **tightly related** (always appear together in the same topic/document), TC will be high. This is a good topic.\n",
    "- If the words are all **independent** (never appear together in the same document or topic), TC = 0. This is a bad topic.\n",
    "- CorEx creates a partition across terms. I.e., **terms can only occur in a single topic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "CorEx roughly follows this algorithm:\n",
    "1. Look for a group of words that are both as broad (in many documents) and overlapping as possible (both together will lead to high TC), and call this a topic.\n",
    "2. Repeat the process for another set of words (not overlapping with your previous group) with as high a TC as possible, and call this the next topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we create more topics, each subsequent topic will have lower TC."
